Instructions for testing Python on Linux

Test your Python Install
------------------------

Linux ships with Python installed, so the goal of this page is to make sure you can start a terminal and run Python from the command line.

* Start up a Terminal. You can find the Terminal application at Applications/Accessories/Terminal, or it may already be on your menu bar.

:note:

    This Terminal contains something called a command prompt. This command prompt is another way of navigating your computer and running programs -- just textually instead of graphically. We are going to be running Python and Python scripts from this command prompt.
* Test your Python install at the command prompt. Type::

    python
    Python 2.7.1 (r252:60911, Jan 24 2011, 17:44:40) 
    [GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

:note:
    
    You just started Python! The >>> indicates that you are at a new type of prompt -- a Python prompt. The command prompt let's you navigate your computer and run programs, and the Python prompt lets you write and run Python code interactively.

:note:

    If the Python version number (2.7.1 in the example above) is not a number between 2.4 and 2.7 (ignoring the number after the second dot), tell a staff member.
* To exit the Python prompt, type::

    exit()

This will take you back to the Linux command prompt.

You might need to install a package called python-tk.

Success!

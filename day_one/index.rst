Day One
=======

Goal #1: set up Python
----------------------

This section has instructions for installing Python and running Python from a command prompt.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   goal_1/windows
   goal_1/osx
   goal_1/linux.rst

Goal #2: prepare a text editor
------------------------------

In addition to being able to run Python, we are going to install a good text editor for writing and saving Python code during the workshop.
If you would like to use a different text editor from the recommendation for your operating system, please let a staff member know.

   goal_2/windows
   goal_2/osx
   goal_2/linux

Goal #3: practice starting and exiting Python
---------------------------------------------

We'll do a lot of learning and practicing at a Python prompt (this is "interactive" because you are typing the code and hitting enter to run it yourself, instead of running it from a file). So let's practice starting and exiting Python.

   goal_3/windows
   goal_3/osx
   goal_3/linux

Goal #4: practice navigating the computer from a command prompt
---------------------------------------------------------------

We will be running files containing Python code (Python "scripts") from the command prompt. You'll need to be able to navigate to those scripts using the command prompt so you can run them. In this section, we'll practice using these navigation commands.

   goal_4/osx
   goal_4/linux

Goal #5: practice running Python code from a file
-------------------------------------------------

Interactive Python programming at a Python prompt is great for short pieces of code and for testing ideas. For longer code, it can be easier to save the code in a file, and execute the contents of that file (aka a Python script). In this section, we'll practice running Python scripts.

Goal #6: get dependencies installed for the Saturday projects
-------------------------------------------------------------

   goal_6/windows
   goal_6/osx
   goal_6/linux

Goal #7: start learning Python!
-------------------------------

It's time to start learning, reading, and writing some Python! Tonight, you'll work through a self-directed tutorial. Saturday morning, we'll have an interactive lecture to cover more Python basics.

:doc:`tutorial`

Goal #8: practice Python using CodingBat
----------------------------------------

Learning about functions opened up a whole new way for us to practice, using the programming site codingbat.com. The big goal of this practice section is to get you thinking about how to solve problems in Python.

:doc:`using_codingbat`

You don't have to create a CodingBat account to do the exercises, but if you do create an account it'll keep track of which problems you've completed and other statistics.

Goal #9: Checkoff
-----------------

Tell a staff member that you are ready to be checked off. Together you will go through the following check-off steps:

* Start a command prompt, and from that command prompt start Python. Then quit Python.
* Create a new Python file (with a .py extension). In that file, type::

   print "Hello World"

and save the file. From a command prompt, navigate to and execute that Python script.

* Open your text editor, and press "Tab". Use the left arrow key to show the instructor that you are using spaces to indent, not tabs.
* To test the ColorWall installation: navigate to the ColorWall directory and run run.py::

   python run.py -a

* To test the Wordplay installation: navigate to the Wordplay directory and run words1.py::

   python words1.py

* To test the Twitter installlation, navigate to the Twitter directory and run twitter_api.py::

   python twitter_api.py --search=python

* Walk through the CodingBat problem that you had the most difficulty with.

If you have any other questions about the tutorial, project setup, or CodingBat questions, now is a great time to ask!

Congratulations!

You are done with the Friday portion of this Workshop. We'll see you at 10am tomorrow! Please bring the laptop you used tonight.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on tonight's material, don't hesitate to let a staff member know.

Day One
=======

Goal #1: set up Python
----------------------

This section has instructions for installing Python and running Python from a command prompt.

   :maxdepth: 2

   goal_1/windows
   goal_1/osx
   goal_1/linux.rst

Goal #2: prepare a text editor
------------------------------

In addition to being able to run Python, we are going to install a good text editor for writing and saving Python code during the workshop.
If you would like to use a different text editor from the recommendation for your operating system, please let a staff member know.

Goal #3: practice starting and exiting Python
---------------------------------------------

We'll do a lot of learning and practicing at a Python prompt (this is "interactive" because you are typing the code and hitting enter to run it yourself, instead of running it from a file). So let's practice starting and exiting Python.

* Windows
* OS X
* Linux

Goal #4: practice navigating the computer from a command prompt
---------------------------------------------------------------

We will be running files containing Python code (Python "scripts") from the command prompt. You'll need to be able to navigate to those scripts using the command prompt so you can run them. In this section, we'll practice using these navigation commands.

* Windows
* OS X
* Linux

Goal #5: practice running Python code from a file
-------------------------------------------------

Interactive Python programming at a Python prompt is great for short pieces of code and for testing ideas. For longer code, it can be easier to save the code in a file, and execute the contents of that file (aka a Python script). In this section, we'll practice running Python scripts.

* Windows
* OS X
* Linux

Goal #6: get dependencies installed for the Saturday projects
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Windows
* OS X
* Linux

Goal #7: start learning Python!
-------------------------------

It's time to start learning, reading, and writing some Python! Tonight, you'll work through a self-directed tutorial. Saturday morning, we'll have an interactive lecture to cover more Python basics.

:doc:`tutorial`

Goal #8: practice Python using CodingBat
----------------------------------------

Learning about functions opened up a whole new way for us to practice, using the programming site codingbat.com. The big goal of this practice section is to get you thinking about how to solve problems in Python.

:doc:`using_codingbat`

You don't have to create a CodingBat account to do the exercises, but if you do create an account it'll keep track of which problems you've completed and other statistics.

Goal #9: Checkoff
-----------------

Congratulations!
